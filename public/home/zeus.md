After completing my studies, I worked with Zeus, LLYC's business intelligence and data visualization platform, helping Spain's top brands like Balearia, Sesame HR, Telef√≥nica, and Astara transform data into actionable insights. My work as frontend engineer involved creating real-time dashboards, optimizing processes, and delivering high-quality interfaces that increased project profitability by over 50%.

I also led non-data monitoring projects, such as developing a the university portal and base application for the Gaias initiative by USFQ, which streamlined student requests and program/ degree management. I designed the whole data structure and application architecture with a robust frotnend-backend account validation and activation service.

As a project lead, I optimized workflows, boosting team productivity by 20-30%, and developed internal tools that enhanced development efficiency and quality, setting a new standard for our team's capabilities.
